Hello everyone,

My name is Rico. I enjoy graphic arts, creating and design new ideas that pops into my head! I am twenty-five currently working on my bachelor's for Graphic Web Designing. I choose to do something more with coding and that is Game Development. Looking forward to working with you all!
